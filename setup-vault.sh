# Welcome to your Second Brain

This vault is managed by **SecondBrainMCP**. Here's how it works:

## Structure

- `notes/` — Your Markdown notes. Organize with subdirectories however you like.
- `references/` — Drop PDF books and papers here. Read-only, never modified.

## Tips

- Notes support YAML frontmatter for titles and tags
- Every successful edit is privately snapshotted for recovery
- Deleted notes go to `.trash/` — nothing is permanently lost
- Use tags to organize: `tags: [project, swift, idea]`

Happy thinking!

# Custom Instructions

> **Note:** The MCP server reads this file on startup. If you edit it mid-session,
> restart the MCP server (or restart your AI client) for changes to take effect.

> **⚠️ Compatibility:** Some AI clients don't automatically follow MCP-provided
> instructions. For example, Kiro requires you to copy these rules into its own
> steering files (`.kiro/steering/`) for them to take effect. If your client has
> a native configuration system for AI instructions, duplicate these rules there
> to ensure they're respected.

Add your vault conventions here. These are sent to the AI on every connection.
For example:

- Folder structure rules
- Naming conventions
- Tagging strategy
- Note templates

Delete this placeholder text and write your own rules, or remove this file
to use only the built-in defaults.
